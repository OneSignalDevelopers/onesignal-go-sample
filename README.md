# OneSignal Go API Sample

OneSignal makes engaging customers simple and is the fastest, most reliable service to send push notifications, in-app messages, SMS, and emails.

This project demonstrates sending push notifications using the OneSignal Go API client. You can use this project as a boilerplate or reference to start your project.

## 🚦 Getting started

This project assumes that you already have a OneSignal app created with push notifications setup. If you don't yet have a OneSignal app, [create one](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/apps-organizations#create-an-app) first, then follow the steps to integrate the OneSignal SDK into your [Android](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/android-sdk-setup) or [iOS](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/ios-sdk-setup) app.

### Steps

1. Make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`
2. Replace the variable descriptions with its respective value from your OneSignal app on the dashboard.
3. Run the command `go run .`
