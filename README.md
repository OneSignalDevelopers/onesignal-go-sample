# OneSignal Go Client Sample

OneSignal makes engaging customers simple and is the fastest, most reliable service to send push notifications, in-app messages, SMS, and emails.

This project demonstrates sending push notifications using the [onesignal-go-api](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/OneSignal/onesignal-go-api) Go package. You can use this project as a boilerplate or reference to start your project.

## üö¶ Getting started

This project assumes that you already have a OneSignal app created with push notifications setup. If you don't yet have a OneSignal app, [create one](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/apps-organizations#create-an-app) first, then follow the steps below to integrate the OneSignal SDK into your [Android](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/android-sdk-setup) or [iOS](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/ios-sdk-setup) app.

1. Rename _.env.example_ to _.env_, `mv .env.example .env`
2. Set environment variables
3. Run the app, `go run .`

Running this example will result in a notification being sent to **all subscribed** users of your OneSignal app and the following output:

```shell
‚ï≠‚îÄiamwill@kronos ~/code/@onesignalDevelopers/onesignal-go-sample ‚Äπmain‚óè‚Ä∫
‚ï∞‚îÄ$ go run .
Response from `CreateNotification`: &{fa7b2782-3ef7-4f44-b8f3-bba3721797a5 5 <nil> <nil> map[]}
Notification ID: fa7b2782-3ef7-4f44-b8f3-bba3721797a5
```

### Environment variables

| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| APP_ID        | URL in app dashboard -> `https://app.onesignal.com/apps/<APP_ID>`               |
| USER_AUTH_KEY | [OneSignal profile page](https://app.onesignal.com/profile)                     |
