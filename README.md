# OneSignal Go Client Sample

OneSignal makes engaging customers simple and is the fastest, most reliable service to send push notifications, in-app messages, SMS, and emails.

This project demonstrates sending push notifications using OneSignal Go client. You can use this project as a boilerplate or reference to start your project.

## üö¶ Getting started

Thi s project assumes that you already have a OneSignal app created with push notifications setup. If you don't yet have a OneSignal app, [create one](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/apps-organizations#create-an-app) first, then follow the steps below to integrate the OneSignal SDK into your [Android](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/android-sdk-setup) or [iOS](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/ios-sdk-setup) app.

1. Rename _.env.example_ to _.env_ `mv .env.example .env`
2. Set environment variables

| Variable | Where to find
|:--|:--|
| APP_ID | URL in app dashboard |
| USER_AUTH_KEY | `https://app.onesignal.com/profile` |
| REST_API_KEY | `https://app.onesignal.com/apps/<<APP_ID>>/settings/keys_and_ids` |

3. Run `go run .`
